# Notebooks
This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that are used to test different elements of code.
The notebooks found here are to document what was done for testing on the path to making what is found in the `script` folder.
These notebooks are not used for any actual processing, loading, or use. All users are to use the code found in `script` to run any and all production level code.
