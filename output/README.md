# Ouptut
The output from the Machine Learning algorithms will go here. The analysis scripts will look for files here to be processed.

- Saved models will be put into a folder here called `models`.
- Each algorithm will have its own folder that gives specific results for that algorithm.
- `cv_results`: The Cross Validation results made while training the algorithms
- `grid_search`: GridSearch results made when tuning hyperparameters
- Files in main section of this directory give output results for all algorithms together.
