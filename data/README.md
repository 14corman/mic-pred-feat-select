# Input Data
All data will be held here. This data will be unprocessed, so it will need processing before being sent to Machine Learning algorithms.

# Test folder
The test folder has generated data that is similar to what the real data looks like. It can be used to compare what a user sees to what the paper has. Test output will be given throughout Repo to make sure other people can reproduce the work here.
