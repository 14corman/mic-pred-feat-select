# Input Data
All data will be held here. There will be 3 places data will be held:
1. main folder (hidden): this is where the actual data will be held when running the code, but cannot be put on Github
2. test folder: A set of files for seeing how real data will be provided, and to build and test code with. Anyone wanting to replicate the findings will be able to use this test folder to test.
3. processed folder (may not be made): The processed folder will be the place where processed data is stored. It may not be created initially as it will be made programatically.

# Test folder
The test folder has generated data that is similar to what the real data looks like. It can be used to compare what a user sees to what the paper has. Test output will be given throughout Repo to make sure other people can reproduce the work here.
